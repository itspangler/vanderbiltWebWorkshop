# Principles for personal websites

---

## Share out from website exercise

In small groups, I want you to take about 15 minutes to reflect on the website exercise that you did in preparation for this workshop. Here were the questions I asked you to bear in mind:

- is it easy to navigate the site?
- is there anything unique to this site?
- what kinds of pages are included?
- what's important to this person?
- how do they tell their story?

Based on the personal websites you found, collaboratively develop a set of principles for what makes a compelling personal website. What kind of info should be included or left out? Generate as many or as few principles as you like, and pick a spokesperson to share with the larger group when we return.
