# Principles for personal websites

---

## Share out from website exercise

In small groups, I want you to take about 15 minutes to reflect on the website exercise that you did in preparation for this workshop. Here were the questions I asked you to bear in mind:

- is it easy to navigate the site?
- is there anything unique to this site?
- what kinds of pages are included?
- what's important to this person?
- how do they tell their story?

Share some examples of websites that left an impression on you, noting where possible what kinds of tools, technologies, and softwares were used to build the site. Then, **collaboratively develop a set of principles for what makes a compelling personal website**. What kind of info should be included or left out? What kinds of design choices are useful to you as a visitor to the page? By what criteria should you make these decisions?

Using this [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1kzx2a8Cf1MjsKCx17qzAunlf3vkxqHtskSK-p5kZ_v0/edit?usp=sharing), generate as many or as few principles as you like, and prepare to share back with the larger group when we return.
