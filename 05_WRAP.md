## Domain names

GitHub automatically generates a pretty crisp domain name, but if you want one that is truly your own, you unfortunately will have to pony up for it. I pay GoDaddy for my domain name. It's not terribly expensive, and they usually give you some kind of deal for the first year or two.

If you want to use a custom domain, you can still set everything up through GitHub as described so far; you'll just need to take the extra step of [configuring a custom domain for your GitHub pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Search engine optimization

Once your website's published, you might notice that you have trouble getting it to the front page of Google. Search engine optimization, or the process of improving traffic to your site, can help with this. I did most of mine through Google's Search Console, and it seems to have worked alright.

## Turnkey alternatives to building from scratch

### GitHub Pages + Jekyll

If all you need is a simple landing page, you can follow the instructions on the Pages tab of GitHub's settings to render a simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file as a static site. [Learn more here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).

### WordPress, Wix, and SquareSpace

Where the GitHub model is free, you'll need to pay a monthly rate for each of these options. They each have their pros and cons.

WordPress is the cheapest and most popular---something like 40% of the web is built on WordPress---but it's also a regular victim of security breaches and data leaks.

I've never used Wix or SquareSpace, so I'll refrain from advising on them. Just know that they are options.
