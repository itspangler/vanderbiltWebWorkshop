- [ ] [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [ ] [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [ ] [Complete the website exercise](#website-exercise)

## Create a GitHub Account and download GitHub Desktop

[GitHub](https:/github.com) is a platform that tracks changes in a directory. Using a [version-control software](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) called [git](https://git-scm.com), GitHub looks at a directory on your local machine and watches it for updates---sort of like how you can track changes in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but for all the contents of a folder or project.

GitHub really handy for building your own websites because it allows you to both host content online for free and serve that content as a static website via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) (like the one you're reading now).

Navigate to GitHub and [create an account](https://github.com/join). You should also [download the desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/), GitHub Desktop.

> Optionally, you can check out Dan Shiffman's introductory videos for using GitHub, "[GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY)," to learn more about GitHub, version control, and how it might be useful for you. We won't go into GitHub in great detail during this workshop, but Dan explains it in plain terms without a ton of technical jargon.

## VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a text editor. If you haven't used a text editor before, it basically combines the functionality of something like Microsoft Word (a word processor) with your file finder (Finder on Mac, or File Explorer on Windows). Importantly, it allows you to view a version of a website on your local machine, which is the interface you'll use to edit your website. Before we meet, [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Website exercise

Finally, spend about 15-20 minutes gathering some examples of personal and/or professional websites that left an impression on you. They could be from your peers, your professors, or people who hold positions outside of academia entirely. Click through at least two websites, considering what works and what doesn't about the site.

Some questions you might reflect on:

- is it easy to navigate the site?
- is there anything unique to this site?
- what kinds of pages are included?
- what's important to this person?
- how do they tell their story?
