# Before the workshop...

Please try to do the following:
- [ ] [Create an GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- [ ] [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [ ] [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [ ] [Complete the website exercise](#website-exercise)

## Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is a platform that tracks changes to a directory. It's really handy for building your own websites because it allows you to both host content online for free and serve that content as a static website (like the one you're reading now).

Before the workshop on 5/2, navigate to GitHub and [create an account](https://github.com/join). You should also [download the desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/), GitHub Desktop.

### Optional: *The Coding Train*

If you want, check out Dan Shiffman's introductory videos for using GitHub, "[GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY)." We won't go into GitHub in great detail here, but he will, and it is a useful skill to have no matter what kind of work you do. You can find him at *The Coding Train* on YouTube.

## VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a text editor. If you haven't used a text editor before, it basically combines the functionality of something like Microsoft Word (a word processor) with your file finder (Finder on Mac, or File Explorer on Windows).

[Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 

## Website exercise

Spend about 15-20 minutes skimming through some websites
