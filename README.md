Welcome to **Being Online: A Workshop on Building Your Own Websites**! This workshop assumes no prior technical experience with hosting content on the web.

What follows is based on the tools that I used to make [my own website](https://itspangler.com). We'll focus on how to create a personal website, for free, without signing up for services like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace (all of which are fine options, for the record, and depending on your capacity, it may make the most sense for you to use one of them).

If you have any questions or see something that doesn't look right, please shoot me an email at `ispangler@leventhalmap.org`.
