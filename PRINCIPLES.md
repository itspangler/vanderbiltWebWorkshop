## Principles for personal websites

---

In small groups, I want us to take about 15 minutes to reflect on the website exercise that you did in preparation for this workshop. Here were the following questions I asked you to bear in mind:

- is it easy to navigate the site?
- is there anything unique to this site?
- what kinds of pages are included?
- what's important to this person?
- how do they tell their story?

Use these 15 minutes to try and develop a set of principles for personal websites. Generate as many or as few as you like, and pick a spokesperson to share with the larger group when we return.
